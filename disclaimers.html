                <p>This implementation of deque_of_unique is provided as an example and should not be used blindly in production code.
                </p>             
                <p>If you find yourself copying and pasting this code into your critical systems without thoroughly understanding its functionality and limitations, don't be surprised if you encounter unexpected behavior or performance issues.</p>
                <p>Remember, when dealing with data structures that require uniqueness, it's essential to validate your inputs and ensure that the implementation meets your specific requirements. Relying solely on this example could lead to unforeseen complications in your application.</p>
                <p>In short, always review, test, and adapt code to fit your contextâ€”especially when it comes to managing unique elements in a deque! Feel free to modify any part of it to better suit your needs!
